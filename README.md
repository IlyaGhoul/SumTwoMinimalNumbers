## Task: Sum of two minimal numbers and tests for them

Write a function that receives an array of numbers as input. The function returns the sum of the two minimum elements of the array.
For example, if an array is given [4, 0, 3, 19, 492, -10, 1], the result will be -10, because the two minimum numbers are -10 and 0, and their sum is -10.
Write at least 3 unit tests for this feature.
HINT: keep in mind that the array can be empty, or without numbers, or consist of 100 million elements, so you need to take into account different boundary conditions.
